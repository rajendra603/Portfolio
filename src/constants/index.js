export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am Rajendra Bansod, a creative and technically driven professional with expertise in animation and web development, along with a solid understanding of both frontend and backend technologies. I recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Animation, which provided me with a strong foundation in visual storytelling, design, and animation techniques, allowing me to bring concepts to life through dynamic visuals.

In addition to my animation background, I completed a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp with Knowledge Hut UpGrad, specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). I am proficient in both frontend and backend development, with hands-on experience in creating responsive and intuitive user interfaces using React.js, as well as building server-side applications with Node.js and Express.js. My skills extend to working with databases, specifically MongoDB, where I efficiently manage and store data in scalable applications.

I am also well-versed in core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap and MUI, which enable me to create polished, user-friendly web experiences. My passion for combining creativity and technology drives me to create full-stack solutions that are both visually compelling and highly functional.

I am eager to contribute my full-stack development expertise, along with my creative design background, to build innovative digital solutions. Continuously learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in both animation and web development, I am excited to collaborate with forward-thinking teams to create exceptional projects.`;
